The attempt to contribute to an open source project has proven to be extremely beneficial. It, greatly, reduced inhibitory factors by demystifying the contributory process. Personally, it was a challenge, to examine my abilities and strengths in a quite big and very fast moving project. Facing the real world of Software Engineering was surely a great experience!

\section{Introduction}
The "Software Engineering in Practise" course is one of the most important in my undergraduate degree, since it has prompted me to gain my first serious experience in this field. Under the supervision of the professor Diomidis Spinellis and the help of PhD candidate Antonis Gkortzis I gained useful knowledge in software engineering that helped me produce as much professional code as I could at this time. I learned about software design, construction, testing, maintenance, management and more, following the book of IEEE "SWEBOK, Software Engineering  Body of Knowledge". Last but not least, I gained a better understanding of git that helped me work on the open source project I chose.
